        text: 'It''s easy to dive right into something as simple as a blog and have a completely viable result in no time at all. I want to be very deliberate in all the decisions I made from the CMS to how I format and style code blocks to how the audience dictates if I will have light mode, dark mode or just a single setting.'

        type: text
        text: 'Maybe more important for client work than a personal site, flexibility is how the CMS handles structuring and manipulating data. Does it allow various post types/collections? Can I easily add fields? How does it handle changing schema updates after content has been published? Determining if I''ll be able to react to changes in the design or site structure is a major concern of mine.'

        text: 'When I say "ergonomics" I''m referring to both the ease of developing a theme, but also the usability of the admin area. A built in asset versioning system that prevents my styles and scripts from being cached is a huge plus. A clean template engine that responds to the flexibility in content modeling is a must. The admin area should be minimal, clean and structure in an obvious way so that anyone can figure out how to edit content.'

Out of the box I''d like to have a flexible cache (ideally static page caching) and image manipulation that handles resizing along with webp conversion.'
